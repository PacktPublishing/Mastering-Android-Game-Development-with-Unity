# Mastering Android Game Development with Unity
This is the code repository for [Mastering Android Game Development with Unity](https://www.packtpub.com/game-development/mastering-android-game-development-unity?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781783550777), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
Game engines such as Unity are the power-tools behind the games we know and love. Unity is one of the most widely-used and best loved packages for game development and is used by everyone, from hobbyists to large studios, to create games and interactive experiences for the Web, desktop, mobile, and console. With Unity's intuitive, easy-to-learn toolset and this book, it's never been easier to become a game developer.


## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
public class playerScript : MonoBehaviour {
    private Animator anim;
    // Use this for initialization
    void Start () {
        anim = GetComponent<Animator>();	
    }

```

You will need the latest version of Unity that can be downloaded from their website and a computer that can run Unity. A basic understanding of C# is required as the code in this book is written in C#. Although the game can run on the android emulator, to see the actual performance of the game an android device would be required.
